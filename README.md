# OpenDEI

OpenDEI is an open source Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion project aiming to provide facilitation training and workshop materials to the tech community. 

Contributers can request to add fleshed out content into the repository or modify existing files with appropriate updates (commenting is highly encouraged!)

## User Guidelines

OpenDEI is completely free and operates under a standard MIT license. As such we encourage users to download the repo or part of the repo for self-use, sharing, and hopefully implementing at your community/organization. We discourage profiting off of this distribution as the spirit of this project is to share content with the open source community
