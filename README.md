# OpenDEI

OpenDEI is an open source Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion project aiming to provide facilitation training and workshop materials to the tech community. 

Contributers can request to add fleshed out content into the repository or modify existing files with appropriate updates (commenting is highly encouraged!)

## User Guidelines

OpenDEI is completely free and operates under a standard MIT license. As such we encourage users to download the repo or part of the repo for self-use, sharing, and hopefully implementing at your community/organization. We discourage profiting off of this distribution as the spirit of this project is to share content with the open source community

## Contributer Community

As a contributer, you may include your new content or make suggestions to modify existing content on the repository. Following standard git practices, you can pull, commit, and push an update for a moderator to merge changes onto the project. Moderators are not in place to filter out content or to gatekeep accessibility. Rather, they are active members of the community that ensure that contributions pass acceptance criteria and do not disrupt existing content. Contributors can also raise issues on the page to discuss content, events, or other topics that may strengthen this community. We invite DEI professionals to collaborate and contribute to this project, and in the spirit of open source development we want to remind you that we are trying to keep content free and accessible. With this in mind, please do not solicit and keep materials you would not want to be distributed freely & widely away from this repo. Also, please please please give credit where its due by citing work that is not yours :)
